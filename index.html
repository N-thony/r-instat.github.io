        <p style="margin-left: 3.5rem; text-align: justify;">This software is designed to support improved statistical
            literacy in Africa and beyond, through work
            undertaken primarily within Africa.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15rem; margin-right: 15rem; text-align: justify;">In resource rich environments, students
            should ideally become familiar with more than one package and
            R-Instat might sometimes be a useful addition to the mix. In resource poor environments R-Instat combined
            with R-Studio is designed to be sufficient for student needs.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The need for the software was described in the 3-minute video in the 2015 <a
                    href="https://chuffed.org/project/africandatainitiative" target="_blank">crowd-sourcing
                    campaign</a>.The
                case was made for software with the properties shown on this <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_YAjLBVPrI&t=1s" target="_blank">video</a>. We are guided by
                road map to deliver
                the quality of the software we need on time.</p>
            <p>R-Instat provides a front-end to R, designed to broaden the users of the software, particularly in
                Africa. "R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and
                graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used
                among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis."</p>
            <p>Râ€™s reputation has grown incredibly in recent years. General information about R is <a
                    href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank" style="color: red;">here</a> while the
                early history of R is
                given <a href="https://www.r-project.org/conferences/useR-2006/Slides/Chambers.pdf" target="_blank"
                    style="color: red;">here</a> . The original Instat was an easy to use statistics package, produced
                at
                the University of Reading, UK. It was designed to support good statistical practice. It also has a
                special menu for the analysis of historical climatic data.
                The ideas behind Instat have motivated the structure of the R-Instat menus and dialogues, though no line
                of the original code remains.</p>

                        <p>David's interests in mathematics are very broad, including statistics and computing. He
                            previously worked as a computer programmer in the UK, in software development. He has been
                            particularly active in mathematics education at all levels and is excited by the
                            opportunities for it to impact African development, given the growing access to technology.
                            In statistics David implemented an e-learning MSc program in Research Methods in Kenya and
                            is currently vice president of the <a href="http://iase-web.org/"

                            managed a number of climatic related projects in Kenya and Ghana. His major contribution in
                            projects has been to bridge the gap between the local institutions and international
                            research.</p>
